# Temp-and-Hum-tracking
 Arduino+python project to track workspaces temperature and humidity

 I noticed changes in temperature and humidity in my workspace
 across the day, so i decided to make a simple arduino project
 to keep an eye on it.

 Since I know how to code in Arduino, I started this project for 
 re-gaining knowledge in python, because I hadn't coded in python for 
 4 yeas.

 Additionaly, this will also allow me to start creating my own internet
 persona, and make easier for everyone to know what I am capable of doing.
